--------------------

smariot:
	- Made pieces move a little faster, and added acceleration and deceleration to their movements.
	- When the game ends, display the winner in the title bar.
	- Made dates for saved games prettier, and add a button to delete them, and have display a message saying there aren't any games rather than displaying an empty window.
	- Turns out I had the move names recorded, so redrawHistory() doesn't need to figure them out each time.
	- Save any games that are still running when the player logs out, and restore them when they return.
	- Added a pretty window for displaying and transversing game history.
	- Quick hack to make my scrollbars work again.
	- Update the TOC version so the thing will actually get loaded.
	- I had at some point written an xboard client for this AddOn. For what purpose, I do not know, but I'll commit it all the same.

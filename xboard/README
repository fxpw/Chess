This is a wrapper program to make the Chess AddOn speak the xboard protocol.

There's absolutely no good reason to want to do such a thing; it was just an interesting project.

There are two relevent scripts here:

wowchess: A lua script implementing the xboard protocol over stdin/stdout, with extra diagnostic information on stderr. It's actually slightly slower than the WoW version, because it doesn't search during its opponents turn.

launch: A bash script that launches xboard and tells it to use the wowchess script for the computer players.
